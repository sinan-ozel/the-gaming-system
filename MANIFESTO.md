## What This Is

This is a roleplaying mechanic to create relatable character with depth. 

## Guiding Principles

The main premise is that the game mechanics should first allow for creating characters relatable to the modern human
experience. After that, we can expand the rules to include other eras, fantasy elements and heroes.

1. Easy: one page for basic encounters, one page for character creation, and that should be enough to play a one-shot game.
2. Natural: Terminology should reflect the day-to-day meaning of expressions.
3. Rolls are for facilitating storytelling and roleplay.
4. Elegant: use as many aspects of a roll as possible, add nothing extra.
5. Relatable: the mechanic should be able to create modern-day characters and put them in modern-day situations.
6. Adaptable: it should be expandable to historical and near-future periods, as well as fantasy and sci-fi elements.
7. Coherent: Rules should not feel arbitrary.
