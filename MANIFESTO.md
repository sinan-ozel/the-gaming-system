# Manifesto

## What This Is

This is a role playing game mechanic designed for flexibility, consistency and relatability.

## Why Is This Happening?

After years of playing D&D, I want something new: I want to be able to role play challenges
other than massacring humanoids in dungeons. I want a system where social encounters 
are a "first-class citizen", not an afterthought. I want a roleplay system where 
teenagers are as easy to create as adults and elderly. I want a roleplay system
where I can create a wide variety of characters, ranging from a medieval farmer 
to a dragon. I want a roleplaying system where creating spells is designed into
the system from the start.


## Guiding Principles

The main premise is that the game mechanics should first allow for creating mundane-but-relatable characters. 
After that, we can expand the rules to include beyond the mundane - fantasy elements, superheroes, monsters,
the supernatural.

1. Easy: one page for basic encounters, one page for character creation, and that should be enough to play a one-shot game.
2. Natural: Terminology should reflect the day-to-day meaning of expressions.
3. Rolls are for facilitating storytelling and roleplay.
4. Elegant: use as many aspects of a roll as possible, add nothing extra.
5. Relatable: the mechanic should be able to create modern-day characters and put them in modern-day situations.
6. Adaptable: it should be expandable to historical and near-future periods, as well as fantasy and sci-fi elements.
7. Coherent: Rules should not feel arbitrary. 
8. Consistent: A spell called "fireball" and a modern accident that involves a gas leakage and a "fireball" should create the same result.
9. Engaging: The rules should give incentive to the players to feel engaged.
