## What This Is

This is a roleplaying mechanic to create relatable characters with depth for any setting ranging from the Medieval era to the Near-Future sci-fi campaigns.

## Why Is This Happening?

Typically, role playing games include characters the I cannot related to whose main vlaue to the world around them is their ability to deal damage.
These mechanics are tailored for challenges that involve around violence, and a world view captures in the Good vs Evil dualism.
However, these are only a small subset of the all challenges that humans face in their lives.
I want to be able run & play campaigns that include violence only as one side of a multi-faceted dynamic, and 
the conflicts are not explained through the boring old good vs evil duality.

## Guiding Principles

The main premise is that the game mechanics should first allow for creating characters relatable to the modern human
experience. After that, we can expand the rules to include other eras, fantasy elements and heroes.

1. Easy: one page for basic encounters, one page for character creation, and that should be enough to play a one-shot game.
2. Natural: Terminology should reflect the day-to-day meaning of expressions.
3. Rolls are for facilitating storytelling and roleplay.
4. Elegant: use as many aspects of a roll as possible, add nothing extra.
5. Relatable: the mechanic should be able to create modern-day characters and put them in modern-day situations.
6. Adaptable: it should be expandable to historical and near-future periods, as well as fantasy and sci-fi elements.
7. Coherent: Rules should not feel arbitrary. 
8. Consistent: A spell called "fireball" and a modern accident that involves a gas leakage and a "fireball" should create the same result.
