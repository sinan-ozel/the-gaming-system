## What This Is

This is a role playing game mechanic designed for consistency, flexibility  and relatability.

## Why Is This Happening?

TODO: Remove this section.

After years of playing D&D, I want something new:
I want to be able to role play challenges other than massacring humanoids in dungeons.
I want a system where social encounters are a "first-class citizen", not an afterthought.
I want a roleplay system where teenagers are as easy to create as adults and elderly.
I want a roleplay system where I can create a wide variety of characters, ranging from a medieval farmer to a dragon.
I want a roleplaying system where creating spells is designed into the system from the start.
Finally, I want a consistent and complete system: if a villain is raising an undead army, or a mage creates a tower, my characters should have rules for making the same.


## Design Goals

### Coherence: If the NPCs can do it, so can the PCs

Often times, the scenario will present players with "flying cities", "undead armies", or "powerful curses". However, the game mechanics have no clear way of creating these effects for the characters.

The game mechanic intends to include ways to create these wondrous accomplishments that
are normally in the realm of the NPCs.

### Diversity in Challenges: Non-violent encounters are "first class citizens" in the system

In movies and literature, we see protoganists faced with different types of conflicts: they can be facing an array of brutal threats in nature, such as drowning, or exposure to elements.
They can be facing social challenges. They can be having internal conflicts.
if they face an external threat, they can find various ways to deal with it. Often times,
in action movies, the protoganist will need to outwit an main antagonist to be able to defeat them.
In contrast, fantasy role playing games tend to have one type of challenge:
there is a main antagonist, in the form of a monster or a humanoid character.
The only way to resolve this conflict is through physical violence.

This is in contrast with the current state of the fantasy literature,
which has moved beyond the oversimplified model of good and evil duality.
Contemporary movies, series and books include complex personalities, and
equally complex challenges that require an array of skills to compete
with - imagine the Witcher series, or Game of Thrones.

In addition to the fantasy literature, imagine the whole array of conflicts
that make the action movie genre: disaster movies, survival movies all
incorporate intense challenges without invoking violence. Nature is
as exciting an adversary as any necromancer, and so is humman limitations.

This game system intends to give the option to create multiple types of challenges.
Elements, natural phenomenon, and even humans' own weakness can be adversaries
and therefore, dice-rolling actors in the game system.


### Relatability: To connect with the characters, we want to use dice rolls that connect to every day experience.

Make rules approachable to the general public.


### Distributed Responsibility
The game master is _not_ the final judge - this is too much responsibility for the game master
to be able to enjoy the game. The responsibility of balancing is now distributed to all players.
There are various rule mechanics that make this possible. For example, for a character to be
accepted, all players need to find the bonuses and dice pools of a character to be convincing.



## Design Principles

### Approachable

Challenges outside of psychopathic massacre of humanoids should be first-class citizens in this system.
In daily life, we face multiple social challenges: job interviews, dates, performances, random encounters.
We can face multiple threats to our well being: fires, floods, natural disasters.
All of these encounters are exciting enough to use in movies, shows and cinema, but rarely make it to fantasy role play.
Somehow, in fantasy role play, we always have to have a fight to death.
This is not the human norm: humans rarely lead lives where they constantly have fights to death - if they did, they would not survive for long.
It is also a small part of cinema and literature: action is just one genre among many.
There are multiple dramatic encounters in literature that have nothing to with interpersonal violence.
These dramatic encounters should not be second-class citizens in a system designed for entertainment, always left to the domain of bards.

### Flexibility

The creative players should not be hindered:
They should be able to create elderly characters, teenagers, exceptionally smart animals, dragons.
Creating spells and powers should not be an extension to gameplay, but a design element incorporated from the start.

### Consistency

How many times have you been told by the DM or the adventure book that there is a "flying city" or that there is "an undead army being raised".
The design should move these narrative elements into gameplay: if an NPC is able to do it, there should be rules for the PCs to do it as well.

### Easy Start

Character creation and basic challenges should each take one page, and should make sense to the modern reader.
It should be easy to create a character that resembles the player themselves, or people that they could meet in the modern world.

Fantasy elements should follow the mundane: first we lay the foundations to create relatable, approachable characters.
Then we expand the rules to incorporate characters and challenges that go beyond the mundane.
