\chapter{Character Creation}

\section{Create an \term{Ordinary} Character}

\begin{marginNote}
	Throughout the book, \term{ordinary} refers to the real world with a scientific explanation,
	whereas \termBeyond{extraordinary} refers to all fantasy elements, ranging from creatures of fantasy to magic and superpowers.
\end{marginNote}


\label{sec:character_creation}

After deciding on the main character concept and the backbone of their background, you can create the character in three steps:

\begin{marginNote}
	The system uses bonuses to represent objective, well-defined phenomenon, and reliable and technological items.
	The dice, in contrast, represent, subjective, unknown and magical phenomenon and items.
	% TODO: Rephrase
\end{marginNote}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Add the ``human'' rolls - this is the \textcolor{colorNatureDark}{orange box} on top in the example on the next page. This is the same for all humans. (Later, we will extend this to include other species, everything from animals to fantasy creatures.)
	\item Assign two dice as their \termCore{core capabilities}. You will roll these two dice to determine their success. (Later, we will add additional dice to rolls to represent magical items and superpowers.)
	\item Based on their years of experience in any area, assign their \termBonus{areas of expertise}. You will add this bonus to the roll. (Technological items can increase this bonus.)
\end{enumerate}

The top box \textcolor{colorNatureDark}{in orange} represents the ``nature'' of the character --- everything that is determined by their species.
The roll shows a dice roll and a bonus to add.
Whenever needed, you will roll the two dice and add the bonus.
These rolls and the bonus are the same for all humans.
(Later on in the book, you will see the rules for other species and for creating your own species.)

The next box \termCore{in dark pink} represents the \termCore{core capabilities} and characters of the character.
These are different for each character.
You will roll these two dice and add the bonus from the \termBonus{areas of expertise} in the box under them.

\begin{marginNote}
	\input{inc/years_of_experience_bonus.tex}
\end{marginNote}

The third box \termBonus{in blue} represents the bonus that they add to the roll to determine success.
This is based on their years of experience, but after the tenth year, each decade increasing the bonus by one.
(See the table on the margin.)
For the purpose of determining ``years of experience'', one of the following must be true:
spending the year working in a job requiring the skill, university years, apprenticeship, and doing it as a hobby all throughout at least one summer all day, or almost all of their personal time.

\begin{formula}{The Basic Game Mechanic}
	\Large
	Roll \termCore{Capability} + Add \termBonus{Bonus} \\ Compare to \termDifficultyLevel{Difficulty Level}
\end{formula}

For example, the sample character on the next page would roll $2d4 + 6$ for a roll requiring cycling.
If the roll is higher than \termDifficultyLevel{the difficulty level}, they pass.


% \begin{enumerate}
% 	\item Based on their childhood \& teenage years, assign their \termCore{core capabilities}.
% 	\item Based on their years of experience, assign their \termBonus{areas of expertise}.
% \end{enumerate}

% \begin{marginNote}
% 	\textbf{TL;DR for Capabilities}
% 	For each core capability,
% 	add either $d4$ or $d6$ from childhood,
% 	add another $d4$ or $d6$ from teenage years.
% \end{marginNote}

% \begin{marginNote}
% 	You do not have to fully finish character generation to start playing.
% 	You can play a flashback scene to the character's childhood or teenage
% 	years when you first need to roll a \termCore{core capability} or
% 	an \termBonus{area of expertise}.
% \end{marginNote}




\newcommand{\explainEE}{The character took 4 years of classes related to Electrical Engineering.This gives +4 bonus under \termBonus{knowledge}.  His work between the ages 24 and 26 involved components used in electrical engineering. This sums up to 6 years, or a bonus of +6.}
\newcommand{\explainEcon}{The character took multiple classes during the master's degree. I decided that this sums up 2 or 3, and went with the lower number.}
\newcommand{\explainFinance}{Two years of classes on finance and no work experience.}
\newcommand{\explainCycling}{The character can cycle: they taught themselves as a kid. For about six summers, they spent a lot of summers cycling. However, it's just the summer, and not the full year. I divide 6 years in half, and get +3 as the bonus.}
\newcommand{\explainDriving}{Driving is something that you would take lessons to learn. Furthermore, it is a mixture of theoretical knowledge and training. So it is classified as a \term{skill}. The character has been driving regularly since the age of 22, so the bonus is +5.}
\newcommand{\explainProgramming}{He started programming at the age of 9, did that as a hobby pretty much every year until the age of 22. I decide to divide this by half - it's not equivalent of full time work. However, between the ages 22 and 26, he worked full time programming a system, so I count that as 4. The total is 10.}
\newcommand{\explainSkepticism}{When the character started work, they found themselves in situations where they need to understand when people are being deceptive. This is the only social talent that this character has. While difficult to quantify in terms of years of experience, the player decides that this is fair based on the character history \& concept.}

\section{Areas of Expertise}

\label{subsec:areas_of_expertise}

How many years did the character spend working to sustain themselves and in training?
This years of experience is represented as a bonus added to the roll, up until the tenth year.
After ten years, each decade counts as +1. For \termBeyond{characters that go beyond normal lifetimes},
after a century, each century counts as +1. See the side table.
Full-time work, apprenticeship, and college education are included.
(For instance, if they took economics classes in one year in college, that one year counts towards the bonus.
If they worked in a job requiring economics knowledge, those years also count toward the bonus.)

Also add hobbies, however, they need to spend either almost of all a summer, or all of their personal time an entire year to qualify for bonus.

\subsection{Creating More Areas of Expertise}

When adding new areas of expertise, to keep bonuses consistent,
authors or DMs can use the principles used to create the table above:

\termBonus{Training} is pure muscle memory, you learn these by training regularly.
You can have a trainer, but what matters is that you train day in, day out.
For example, if they went \termBonus{Bouldering} every weekend or so for two years, count each one of those as a half year, because it is part time, and assign +1.
Alternatively, if the character taught a form of \termBonus{offensive martial arts} for five years, assign +5 as the bonus.\par

\termBonus{Skills} are things that require concentration to accomplish.
In a modern setting, these are skills needed for blue-collared jobs, vocations or hobbies.
In pre-industrial settings, these are skills required for most creafts and to make a living as a regular person.

\termBonus{Knowledge} is pure theory.
In the modern setting, these are 100-level university courses, or sometimes, night classes.
Consider all years studying in the university to calculate the bonus, as well working in a job which actively requires the knowledge in question.
In other settings, also consider the years fully apprenticing.
When adding more areas of \termBonus{knowledge} to the campaign, consider the following:
If you go to 200-level or 300-level courses, it is too specific for the game mechanic.
For pre-industrial settings, consider the highest level of education that will prepare the character for a high-paying job, or a respectable role in the society that requires specific knowledge.
This can be schooling in magic, or it can be apprenticing scholars, or working with elders in a tribe or band.
\par
\termBonus{Talents} are social, and cannot be easily taught, characters get better at these by doing.\par

If something can be taught with less then one hour of instructions, that is not an area of \term{expertise}.
This is something that an adult should be able to do very easily after hearing the instructions,
so the \term{difficulty level} of using such an equipment will likely be 3 on simple checks,
and should be determined only by the \term{core capability}.
This includes crossbox and modern firearms.
\footnote{``Firearms'', listed under knowledge, is about encyclopedic knowledge of firearms and their maintenance, not for shooting.}

\end{center}

\section{Spicing Up Character Creation}

\subsection{Roleplaying the Formative Years}

You can roleplay a character's childhood moments and roll to determine
the \termCore{core capabilities}.

When roleplaying a childhood flashback scene, start with $1d4$ for all dice. If they roll a \emph{one},
during the scene, the actor learns a lesson, and they can upgrade the dice to $1d6$,
or they can earn their second die as a $d4$. This counts as a \term{rite of passage}
moment into being a teenager. Whatever the \termCore{core capability} is at the end of
such a scene is, should be the dice that the actor rolls when roleplaying as a teenage flashback scene.


Similarly, a teenage flashback scene can include such ``earning the dice'' moments.
In the teenage case, start with the two dice. This can be $2d4$ or another set of two
dice that was set at the end of a When the scene is finished, the dice should
determine the starting core capability of an adult.

You can use this mechanic to fully flash out a character, if desired.
\todo{This is going to be fully detailed in a future release.}

\subsection{Wealth \& Looks --- the Birth Lottery}

Is an actor born into wealth? Roll $d10$ to find out their percentile:
If a 9 is rolled, they are in the top 10 percentile in terms of their families' wealth.
If a 0 is rolled, they are at the absolute bottom of the society.
If desired, you can roll another $d10$ to get the precise wealth level of the individual.
If you roll two 9's in a row, you are born a ``one percenter''.

Looks uses the same mechnic: Roll $d10$. If the roll is 6, looks-wise, most actors in
your society are likely to think of the actor as a 6.

This type of lottery mechanic can be used throughout the game, as well as the character creation.
For example, if one of the players ask whether an orc is considered to be ``good looking'' by orc standards,
the GM can roll to answer this question. See \nameref{sec:lottery_mechanic} for more details.


\section{Advance the Character}

Rules for advancing --- ``levelling up'' --- the character are in the
Section~\nameref{subsec:character_advancement}.


\section{Place Characters in Campaigns}

			% TODO: Finish the character creation when the character sheet is finished.
			% TODO: Link to the powers of fey
	\end{xltabular}
\end{center}

\section{Balance Gameplay for Characters}

With this level of flexibility, finding the right difficulty for the challenges may be difficult. Look at the players' rolls, and find the maximum roll possible. For example, for an young professional,
this number is likely going to be 18: This is going to be a roll with a \term{core capability} where they are particulary talented, so this is going to be 2d6. The highest possible roll is 12. They probably have at least five or six years of experience in their job, so this brings us up to 18. This is the character's \term{mundane level}.

Plan a scene around one climatic challenge at this \term{difficulty level}, potentially for another \term{core capability} and another area of \term{expertise}. They should have a very low or zero probability of passing. However, using item bonuses, their \term{resources}, and planning, they should be able to bring this to a high probability event. There will still be the probability of a double-one, a \term{misfortune}. Even if they are very well prepared when they face the challenge, if they roll double ones, they may still pass, but a misfortune falls upon them.
