\subsection*{A Small Fire}

Fire is a beast: it has no reasoning or situational awareness, but it has the capability to burn.
\begin{characterSheet}
	\begin{tabular}{lr|}
		\multicolumn{2}{c}{Capabilities}\\
		\hline
		Burn & 1d4 \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{characterSheet}

Each round, fire rolls its \termCore{Burn}. Every time it rolls the face die,
it spreads into an adjacent tile. The face die is 4 at start but it increases as it spreads.
Once it goes over 4 tiles in either direction, its \termCore{Burn} increases.
The maximum number of tiles in a row in each direction determines one of the dice in the \termCore{Strength} roll, rounded up.
\todo{Add an image using tikz.}\\

\todo{Describe how to douze the fire.}
\todo{Describe what happens if the fire rolls a double-one.}

\subsection*{A Squirrel}
Small mammals and lizards have the following two core competencies at 1d4.
They use \termCore{Situational Awareness} to recognize food and danger,
and \termCore{Coordination} to avoid them.
Unlike domesticated pets and familiars, they cannot communicate with
humans, so they have no \termCore{Communication}.
Please do not hurt them.\\

\todo{Add skills: gather nuts, evade}
\todo{Add physiology: size & bite strength, speed}

\subsection*{A Dog}
Dogs have the following four core competencies at 1d4.
Unlike many other animals, they can communicate with humans.
Their bite attacks are \termCore{Coordination} + Jaw Strength\\
