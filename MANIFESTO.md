## What This Is

This is a role playing game mechanic designed for flexibility, consistency and relatability.

## Why Is This Happening?

After years of playing D&D, I want something new:
I want to be able to role play challenges other than massacring humanoids in dungeons.
I want a system where social encounters are a "first-class citizen", not an afterthought.
I want a roleplay system where teenagers are as easy to create as adults and elderly.
I want a roleplay system where I can create a wide variety of characters, ranging from a medieval farmer to a dragon.
I want a roleplaying system where creating spells is designed into the system from the start.
Finally, I want a consistent and complete system: if a villain is raising an undead army, or a mage creates a tower, my characters should have rules for making the same.


## Design Principles

### Approachable

Challenges outside of psychopathic massacre of humanoids should be first-class citizens in this system.
In daily life, we face multiple social challenges: job interviews, dates, performances, random encounters.
We can face multiple threats to our well being: fires, floods, natural disasters.
All of these encounters are exciting enough to use in movies, shows and cinema, but rarely make it to fantasy role play.
Somehow, in fantasy role play, we always have to have a fight to death.
This is not the human norm: humans rarely lead lives where they constantly have fights to death - if they did, they would not survive for long.
It is also a small part of cinema and literature: action is just one genre among many.
There are multiple dramatic encounters in literature that have nothing to with interpersonal violence.
These dramatic encounters should not be second-class citizens in a system designed for entertainment, always left to the domain of bards.\\

### Flexibility

The creative players should not be hindered:
They should be able to create elderly characters, teenagers, exceptionally smart animals, dragons.
Creating spells and powers should not be an extension to gameplay, but a design element incorporated from the start.

### Consistency

How many times have you been told by the DM or the adventure book that there is a "flying city" or that there is "an undead army being raised".
The design should move these narrative elements into gameplay: if an NPC is able to do it, there should be rules for the PCs to do it as well.

### Easy Start

Character creation and basic challenges should each take one page, and should make sense to the modern reader.
It should be easy to create a character that resembles the player themselves, or people that they could meet in the modern world.\\

Fantasy elements should follow the mundane: first we lay the foundations to create relatable, approachable characters.
Then we expand the rules to incorporate characters and challenges that go beyond the mundane.
