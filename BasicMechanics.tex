\chapter*{Challenges}

\begin{emphasisParagraph}
	For basic challenges, the player rolls a \term{core competency} to overcome a \term{difficulty level (DL)}.
	Often, but not always, the bonus from \term{expertise} gets added.
	The result of the roll has to be equal to or greater than this number to succeed.
\end{emphasisParagraph}
\todo{Does the success level matter? Think on it.}

\paragraph*{Guideline on Deciding the Difficulty Level}

Imagine a talented character (2d6 in their \term{core capability}) with 20 years of experience.
This character's roll is 2d6 + 12 without any additional bonuses.
This means that they are approximately 50\% likely to overcome a challenge with \acronymDL 18.
It also means that they can overcome a challenge with \acronymDL 24 with a lot of luck - only 1/36 of the time.\\

}

Now consider a regular person with no \term{expertise}. This person will roll d6 + d4.
They cannot overcome a challenge with 12,
and they will fail at relatively basic challenges of \acronymDL 5 half of the time.\\
