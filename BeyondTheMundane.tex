\chapter*{Going Beyond The Mundane}

There are three game mechanics for going beyond the \term{mundane}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If you create a character (or advance them) with one of their \term{core competencies} above 2d6, that is going beyond the mundane. They are going to have an easier time passing challenges that are difficult for regular charactersm as their dice increases to d6 + d8, d6 + d10 or 2d8, and so on.
    \item If you add a third die to one of the \term{core competencies}, this also takes the character beyond the mundane. This is more powerful than the previous option, but is also more penalizing, because it increases the probability of rolling a double one, a \term(misfortune).
    \item Finally, you can add spellcasting or supernatural powers to the character.
\end{enumerate}

Any combination of these are possible. The following sections describe these in further detail.

\section*{Increasing Core Competencies Beyond 2d6}

This is the basic way of creating a character beyond the \term{mundane}.
\marginpar{
    \footnotesize
    \input{inc/core_competencies_dicepool_transmundane.tex}
}

A typical talented adult will have a 2d6 in their best \term{core competency}.
A slightly more powerful character can have d6 + d8.
Going even further beyond, either the higher die or the lower die can be increased.\\

This type of \term{transmundane} character is fit for superhero campaigns,
and for creating enemies that are immensely powerful, such as ancient vampires.

\todo{Add an example, and also show that the character's mundane level changes.}

\todo{What are the rules for character advancement?}
\todo{What is the significance of increasing the larger die rather than the smaller?}

\section*{Adding a Third Die}

This is how you create tragic characters, PC and NPC alike.
This is a powerful way of making the character powerful, but with a cost.
The character will have an easier time passing regular challenges,
however, their probability of rolling a double one, therefore a \term{misfortune}
will be increased.\\

This is for roleplaying potentially dangerous or forbidden magic, alien technology and contracts with otherworldly entities.

\section*{Spells and Powers}

The purpose of this section is to give a consistent framework to give a way to create spells and powers to both players and GMs.
For consistency, they are both part of the same mechanic.
All spells \& powers have a desired effect, and a \term{difficulty level}.
Depending on their \term{class}, the character uses a particular \term{core competency} \& \term{expertise} to determine the roll.
Their \term{scoore} matters if another character needs to dispell or counteract the effect.

\todo{Add a table of spells \& powers}

\section*{Transmundane Classes}

Classes are only for \term{transmundane} characters.\\

To balance gameplay for \term{transmundane} player characters,
sum the \term{difficulty level} of their \term{transmundane} powers.
This is going to be their \term{transmundane level}.
\todo{
    Finish this thought.
}\\

\subsection*{Wizards}

As a player roleplaying \termClass{wizard}, you can either choose your spells from the list below,
or create your own spells by doing research (in real life), and convincing the party and the GM
that the difficulty level is correct.

\subsection*{Mages}

\subsection*{Druids}

\subsection*{Demonologists \& Summoners}

\subsection*{Witches \& Warlocks}

\subsection*{Sorcerors \& Sorceresses}

\subsection*{Vampires}

\subsection*{Werewolves}

\subsection*{Superheroes}
