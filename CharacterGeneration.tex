\chapter*{Character Creation}

Generating a character like writing a social network profile or a CV: Based on the character idea, formulate their \term{core competencies}. Then based on their years of experience, list their \term{skills}, \term{talent} and \term{knowledge}. Finally, list their \term{assets} (?).

\section*{Core Competencies}

\term{Core competencies} are the strength \& weaknesses. They determine the dice roll.

\coreCompetencyTable{2d6}{d4 + d6}{2d6}{2d4}{2d6}{2d6}{d4 + d6}{d4 + d6}{2d4}

Guidelines to create a mortal character:
\marginpar{
	\footnotesize
	\input{inc/core_competencies_dicepool_guide.tex}
}
if you want your character to be exceptional at a \term{core competency}, assign 2d6. If you want them to be bad at it, assign 2d4 - this is where you find role play opportunities. If you think that they are average, or if you do not know how good they are, or if you are simply undecided, assign d4 + d6. Finally, if you want them to be teenagers, figuratively or literally, assign just d6 to the relevant \term{core competency}, or all \term{core competencies}.\footnote{
 	Larger dice (d8, d10, ...) are reserved for heroes, superheroes and supernatural characters.
 	These are action movie protoganists, villains, comic book heroes, vampires.
 	The largest dice are for divine beings and legendary characters.
 	A \term{third dice} is for representing creativity, but also dangerous, forbidden magic and alien technology:
 	they increase the sum, but also the risk of rolling \term{double one}s.
}

\section*{Expertise}

\term{Knowledge, training \& talents} are bonuses added to dice rolls. Assign these bonuses based on the character's background: Bonus equals the years of experience, and after the tenth year, count each decade as one point. Less than six months counts as half-year, round up or down as desired. Flesh out as much as desired, extend the \term{knowledge}, \term{training} and \term{talents} depending on the setting and the focus of the campaign. There is no limit, but it needs to make sense to \emph{all} other players when you are introducing your character.\\

\marginpar{
	\footnotesize
	\input{inc/years_of_experience_bonus.tex}
}


\newcommand{\explainEE}{The character took 4 years of classes related to Electrical Engineering.This gives +4 bonus under \term{knowledge}.  His work between the ages 24 and 26 involved components used in electrical engineering. This sums up to 6 years, or a bonus of +6.}
\newcommand{\explainEcon}{The character took multiple classes during the master's degree. I decided that this sums up 2 or 3, and went with the lower number.}
\newcommand{\explainFinance}{Two years of classes on finance and no work experience.}
\newcommand{\explainCycling}{The character can cycle: they taught themselves as a kid. For about six summers, they spent a lot of summers cycling. However, it's just the summer, and not the full year. I divide 6 years in half, and get +3 as the bonus.}
\newcommand{\explainDriving}{Driving is something that you would take lessons to learn. Furthermore, it is a mixture of theoretical knowledge and training. So it is classified as a \term{skill}. The character has been driving regularly since the age of 22, so the bonus is +5.}
\newcommand{\explainProgramming}{He started programming at the age of 9, did that as a hobby pretty much every year until the age of 22. I decide to divide this by half - it's not equivalent of full time work. However, between the ages 22 and 26, he worked full time programming a system, so I count that as 4. The total is 10.}
\newcommand{\explainSkepticism}{The character grew up in a scientifically-minded household, went to a school with classes on theory of knowledge. Furthermore, when they started work, they found themselves in situations where they need to understand when people are being deceptive, and they lacked other social skills. While difficult to quantify in terms of years of experience, the player decides that this is fair based on the character history \& concept.}

% 	If worked on something more than half of a year, that's a full year, round up. If less than a year (for instance, summers only) divide the total number of years by half.
% }


\term{Knowledge} is pure theory. In the modern setting, these are 100-level university courses. They can be purely academic, or they can be useful at high-income jobs.\\
\term{Training} is everything that you learn mainly by doing: 
they will have a technical component, and may require taking some classes, but you will learn if you actually keep doing them.
In the modern setting, think of everything you would learn in night classes, or by working with an individual, or with a coach or a trainer.
In other settings, they may be used through apprenticeship.
These may be useful in a medium-income jobs.\\
\term{Talents} cannot be easily taught, you have to learn these by doing. 
In the modern setting, these are useful in social situations.
However, in other settings, they can include any other talent that is innate or developed.
They are transferrable across jobs and even different campaign settings.\\

\subsection*{Dice Roll Examples}

This character is a technically proficient young professional. The following are a list of situations and the rolls that the character above would need to make. 
Some of these situations are in the modern setting, some of them are in fantasy settings. The same character can be used without modification in all of them.
How successful they will be is another question.
