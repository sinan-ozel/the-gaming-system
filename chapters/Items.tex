\section*{Overview of Items}

Items change either the dice or the bonus in a roll.
The exact change depends on the type of item.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item They can change the first two dice in the pool. These are either magical items, are individually crafted.
	\item They can add a bonus. These are technological, and typically mass-produced.
	\item They can add dice to the pool. This mechanic is for more powerful magical items that also come with risks.
	\item They can do any combination of the above
\end{enumerate}


These rules rely on the following general perspective:
Dice are for representing \termMagic{magic}, probability, and chance.
Set bonuses are for representing the impact of technology, mass production and reliable-but-specialized impact.
\begin{marginNote}
	Campaign idea: introduce a new technnology that replaces an area of expertise of the players' characters. See how they deal with it.
\end{marginNote}
As such, technological items and expertise are substitudes for each other.


\begin{emphasisParagraph}
	In other words, technology can replace areas of expertise, just as it has done in our world for a long time.

								for example, instead of getting +1 from a minute of research,
								the actor using the mobile device gets +2.
								The bonus may be limited depending on the particular year \& technology (90s internet had less information),
