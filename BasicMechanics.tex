\section*{The Basic Mechanic}
For basic challenges, the actor rolls a \term{core capability}..
A \term{physiology} or \term{expertise} bonus is added.
The result of the roll has to be equal to
or greater than the \term{difficulty level (DL)} to succeed.\\

\paragraph*{The Bonus Limit}
The bonus cannot be greater than the maximum roll of the \term{core capability},
unless an \term{item}, \term{spell} or \term{power} specifically allows this.
For example, if the roll is 2d6, the bonus can be at most +12. If the roll is d4 + d6,
the bonus cannot be more than 4 + 6 = 10.\\

\paragraph*{The Double One}
\marginpar{
	\begin{mdframed}[style=d20ComparisonBoxStyle,frametitle=Compare to d20]
		\footnotesize
		Think of rolling a \term{double one} similar to a rolling a natural one in d20.
		The difference is this: the player can still win.
		However, regardless of whether they won, they face a misfortune.
	\end{mdframed}
}


If the roll has two 1's, this is a \term{double one}.
This is the GM's opportunity to introduce a misfortune to the game:
The actor, either the player or an NPC, may still win, thanks to their bonus.
However, circumstances outside their control or a tragic character flaw creates a misfortune.
This rule applies to both players and NPCs. \\

In the circumstances where three dice are rolled,
a \term{double one} is enough to trigger a misfortune.
This mechanic increases the probability of a misfortune
whenever a third die is added. The purpose is to create
opportunities to roleplay immense power that comes at a
cost.\\
\todo{Add some NPC and PC examples.}

\paragraph*{Guideline on Deciding the Difficulty Level}

Imagine a talented character (2d6 in their \term{core capability}) with 20 years of experience.
This character's roll is 2d6 + 12 without any additional bonuses.
This means that they are approximately 50\% likely to overcome a challenge with \acronymDL 18.
It also means that they can overcome a challenge with \acronymDL 24 with a lot of luck - only 1/36 of the time.\\

Now consider a regular person with no \term{expertise}. This person will roll d6 + d4.
They cannot overcome a challenge with 12,
and they will fail at relatively basic challenges of \acronymDL 5 half of the time.\\
